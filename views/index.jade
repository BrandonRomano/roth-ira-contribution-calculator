  h2 Editors Notes
  p * This is effectively the amount of money that you've made, but you can't subtract losses/expenses that are usually considered write-offs.
  p + Very frequently, this is the same value as your Modified Adjusted Gross Income.  You can figure out this value by completing your 1040 form.  This value is the value on line 43.
